  Admiralty held in Spanish Town on Friday, last week. She was sold for 1500L."

  Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, that no supply from the islands,
  either of wheat or flour, can possibly be obtained from the American states in
  consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these
  articles. Our charity, therefore, if we have any of these articles to spare,
  must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised,
  particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home, that no
  assistance can be given at present, either to the French or Dutch.

  Cent is the only coinage the Americans have of their won. No less than 300 ton
  of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787, to be coined at the
  rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them
  all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British
  halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold
  coins of all nations, however, pass current. The congress have not yet ordered
  a silver coinage.

  of the Canada Bill, which has been so much talked of an procrastinated so
  long, and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the
  production of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by the province to negotiate this
  afair. It is remarkable,withhis former publication, for its strong nervous
  elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.

  Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of
  the East India Company, and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were
  retired, the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from India, I
  have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon
  them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, "That he could receive no such money
  without the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him
  of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The
  Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe;
  the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap
  from it, cannot, in my opinion, look upon himself as a strictly honest man."
  Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the Chairman had not had time to give
  him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a letter, including a
  Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid any
  thing.

  on his extensive domains. By this plan, proposed to his Lordship by Mr.
  Fraser, the settlers are to have perpetual feus of the lands, subject to a

  threatened emigrations to America, and deserve the highest praises of his

  Trade is reviving in America to a very great degree –and such is the
  appearance of things that in a very few years, we may expect to see as firm an
  union of mercantile interests, betwixt this country and the United States, as
  ever subsisted. It is in vain to instil prejudices against Great Britain, in
  the mind of an American merchant ; he knows this to be the ready-money market,
  and he will come to it accordingly.

  apprehensions. The account of the insurrections in Martinique, which we
  received through France, and which has been since confirmed in the National
  Assembly, naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy to
  inform our readers, that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult
  of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring any account of
  the conspiracy in Martinique ; a circumstance which can only be accounted for
  by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of
  the year."

  Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which is only about nine miles to the
  Northward of Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of Holland, as one of the
  finest harbours in the world, in which 1000 sail of the line might ride in
  perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor
  chose in preference, which is about hal a mile in length, and a quarter of a
  mile across at the entrance. Here was the finest spring water, and ships can
  anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence quays may be
  constructed, at which the largest vessels may constantly unload. His meeting
  with the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. The appearance of the
  place was picturesque and pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for
  botanical acquisitions.

  The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans, which will
  give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a
  commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for
  giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the Minister will have
  to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to
  encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are
  comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the
  descendants of French, and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.

  Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arrived there from Hispaniola, there
  are advices that the French inhabitants of that island feel, with unabating
  energy, the glorious cause in which their patriotic countrymen in Old France
  are embarked. Men of every class and description wear the national cockade of
  blue and white. Their accounts from France, similar in date and substance to
  ours, have filled them with the most lively hopes, and animated them with a
  spirit of resistance to the measures of their Government, as forcible as it
  was unexpected by those entrusted with the executive power. At Port au Prince
  both the Governor and Intendant have rendered themselves completely odious, by
  vain attempts to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The effigy of
  Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist
  that both shall immediately quit the colony, and their departure is hourly
  expected. The press, hitherto under the severest restraint, triumphs in its
  freedom; and their weekly publications give an account of the proceedings of
  the States General without the smallest reserve.

  The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now
  setting in, will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that when
  this season commences early, and with severity, in Newfoundland, and the more
  northern part of North America, it becomes extremely rigorous, and of a
  proportionate continuance there. When, in the above climate, the winters have
  been severe, they have invariably been mild with us, and vice versa. Now, the
  ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last, saw the
  hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of
  a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one, nature,
  in her bounty, has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of
  wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller birds, who would otherwise
  perish, a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to
  prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which they are accustomed to
  feed. The present season, the store of these wild fruits is extremely
  moderate.

  November 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb
  entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this
  town on board l'Illustre, of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the
  state yacht and barge, received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12
  o'clock–and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board, a
  signal gun was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron was
  beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at the ship,
  the company were very politely received by the Viscount, and conducted to the
  state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the
  whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and
  delicacies, in a hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully
  decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having thirteen
  metal guns, by which from tubes that communicated through the table, and the
  company were saluted with a f–deral discharge. On the top of the castle waved
  a small white ensign–the device, two hearts –the motto, " The United hearts of
  America and France." The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced
  with arrows–and in the motton, " Homage to the fair daughters of America," a
  fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner,
  the ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his
  Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at
  some distance from the ship.

  By letters from the New York Packet, dated October 6, from Philadelphia, we
  learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States, and that
  the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been
  bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods, imported the
  last season was immense, goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will
  always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of
  fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given
  them great prospects of commercial advantages, and a seven years war is what
  the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.

  said, through his interpreter, " that even in his won country he should be
  unable to repay it ; however, at present he would do the utmost in his power
  ;" on this he ordered the actor to approach him, and then lighting his
  Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles, he too three

  whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor,

  The Indian ships lately returned from Madras and Bengal, gives unfavourable
  accounts of all the branches of commerce, except that of matrimony, which has
  succeeded wonderfully in the last female exportations. Out of eleven ladies,
  who embarked on a marriage venture on board the Chesterfield, Captain Burgess,
  nine were connubially linked to weakly husbands within three months after
  their arrival and the other two were left in a way to complete this fortunate
  band of hymeneal adventu- rers.

  Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, says that the Indians in Washington
  county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire
  to several houses; and a woman, who had a sick husband, telling them from a
  window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on the spot, and then set fire to
  the spot. The sick man was consequently burnt.

  Longevity. –At Taconey, a small village about seven miles from Philadelphia,
  there is now living a shoemaker of the name of Robert Glen, who in December
  last attained the great age of one hun - dred and fourteen years. Scotland was
  the place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and was
  present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his memory nor his sight,
  are in the least impaired; and such is his strength, that after working all
  the week at his profession, he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia, and
  back. His third wife is now living, and is not more than thirty years old.

  By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sunday last, at Greenock, from
  Quebec, after a passage of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from
  Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an engagement between a
  detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the
  49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of the Canadian militia, and a
  body of American troops, amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat of
  the latter, with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the
  American General to advance to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he
  has now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side
  of the river where the action was fought, and being actively pursued in his
  retreat by the British troops.

  Stores and provisions at the said settlement, had absconded from their
  habitations, and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine
  and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves, and taken the
  command of a gang of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed
  numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers, driving away their cattle,
  and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall
  return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next, shall be
  pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful
  murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as outlaws.

  Convicts destined for Botany Bay. –It is now seven weeks since the ten Derby
  convicts were sent off with several others, whose destination for the rest of
  their lives is Botany Bay. They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the
  Retribution, put on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to land them at
  their place of punishment. The number on board that ship, on leaving
  Sheerness, was between 2 to 300, many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their
  condition has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that
  has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceeded farther than the Downs
  when she lost her rudder, by some accident or other. She returned to
  Sheerness, where she now lies, and where she is likely to lie for some time,
  upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for
  delay, however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led to expect
  that some important mitigation of their sentence has taken place ;–so that
  between the suspense, and the terrible species of confinement to which they
  are subject, their sufferings are hardto be described.– Observer.

  In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last,
  respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of the
  disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet with, we
  have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who
  appears very angry, and, like most other angry men, seems more anxious to give
  full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause
  of quarrel is, that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a
  prevailing defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the
  authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The remarks
  of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking: –

  Leeds, April 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here to-day, though no bad
  consequences have followed, by a most numerous assemblage of croppers,
  cloth-dressers, and other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep
  coming in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Armley, Holbeck, and
  all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is computed that at one time
  there were full three thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly
  in Briggate. As many of them marched into the town with great sticks in their
  hands, they created some little alarm, but their conduct was uniformly
  peaceable; their complaints were not loud, though they might be deep ! The
  worthy Mayor and Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in
  readiness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, there was
  not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater number
  of the assemblage dispersed by noon, and returned to their respective homes.
  Several respectable gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of
  their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not appear that they
  have the least disposition to commit any breath of the peace ; but in fact,
  the people know not what to do in their present state of distress. I
  understand that an active subscription is going, to enable a number of these
  poor men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their
  wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they can obtain the sanction of
  Government. The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their
  numbers augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.

  The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednesday se'ennight, with about two
  hundred passengers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir Gregor M'Gregor, who lately
  landed on the Spanish Main with a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems,
  left authority with Colonel Eyre to recruit men for his service, and to ship
  them as he best could. – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin at
  present, and also many in the country, who have been captivated with the
  speculation of embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some time they have
  appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has
  formed a Committee, who treat with such young gentlemen as have the
  inclination to proceed on the enterprise, and have money to pay for such rank
  as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor. The money thus furnished is made a
  stock purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence it is necessary that
  the greater part of the adventurers should be officers ; for those who are
  contented with the humble station of privates are not required to contribute
  and their passage, subsistence, &amp;c. must be defrayed by the common fund.
  Mr D'Evereaux, from the county of Wexford, is also raising men for the same
  service, but under different circumstances. He professes to have authority
  from General Bolivar to grant commissions, and to ship the men he may raise
  for head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men,
  and Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this respect. – Dublin

  Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated 22d November, 1819:--"An
  afflicting circumstance has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, a
  Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board his ship, which was about
  to sail for England. The party was very small, and more than half were taken
  ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I buried the Captain and the
  Surgeon a few days after it; not less than ten of the part died within as many
  days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives of those who left England
  in the ship, and he is just recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of
  conjectures were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 undressed
  buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete state of putrefaction. This vessel
  has sailed for England in this state without a Surgeon. I question whether it
  will ever arrive; it ought not to be admitted among other shipping if it
  does;–the opening of the hold will be death to him who does it, and perhaps to
  many more."--In consequence of this disastrous information, Ministers have
  issued an order for the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other
  part, to undergo quarantine.– London Paper.

  The New York Daily Advertiser says–"The line of battle ship New York, now
  finishing at our navy yard, at the Wallabut, is perhaps the most superior
  vessel ever built. Her tonnage is near 3000[?]: she measures 203 feet keel,
  and is by 15 feet the largest man of war ever laid down in this country. She
  will no doubt be rated a 74, but will be equal to a 100 gun-ship, and will
  carry 120 guns."

  Mr Secretary Peel, in moving the commitment of the Transportation Bill,
  stated, that the objects of the bill were, first, to continue the laws on
  transportation, that would expire before the next session ; and next, to
  cimplify the law. In the last session a bill had been passed to enable the
  Crown to make an experiment of the union of the hulk and transportation
  system, by sending convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to
  decide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it was
  satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transportation was a very
  esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great different in the effect of
  the punishment upon a man of settled habits, and with a family, and upon a man
  of no fixed habits, to whom, as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a
  punishment. He wished it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New
  South Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the settlement,
  where the punishment would be more severe. A selection would be made from the
  convicts, so as to make the punishment efficient against those to whom it had
  hitherto had no terror.– He gave this statement because it was right the
  public should know that transportation would be henceforward a real
  punishment.

  Committee have resolved to send out as soon as possible. The regular hearers
  of the missionaries are two-thirds more than the members, and there are 12,000
  children educated in the schools. The Report goes on to give every animating

  Love in a Prison. –We have all heard that "Love rules the court, the camp, the
  grove" but we have rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in
  prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity, nevertheless, that he seems, if
  not to have fixed his dwelling in, at least to be a very constant visitor of,
  our jail. It is not long since a couple, who had imbided the tender passion,
  were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation, most
  devoutly to be wished for by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken
  place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a petition has been
  presented by two delinquents of different sexes, both under sentence of
  transportation, to the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to marry
  before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair never saw each other
  till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth
  Circuit, for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omnipotent
  love–took the captives captive, and rendered them in its enjoyment, even in
  their perilous plight, "o'er a' the ills o' life victorious." But, alas! " the
  course of true love never did run smooth;" and no less a personage than the
  Secretary of State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path
  of the hapless couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for many a year,
  by ordering the "fair penitent" to be removed to Penitentiary at Millbank for
  seven years, instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the forlorn
  lover to seek consolation in the charms of some sterling or currency damsel in
  the land of promise, to which he must now wend his solitary way.– Fife Hld.

  Bervic. –There has been raised this season on the high lands of the farm of
  Hallgreen, belonging to Mr Blair, a few acres of Rib-grass, a native plant of
  New South Wales. It was imported to this country two years ago by a man who
  had served his time in Van Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be
  high land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it appears not only
  to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed with which it comes in contact. It is
  said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for
  producing mik from cows, of the best and richest quality. Were the propiertors
  and tenants of the Highland country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr
  Blair, we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful plant,
  instead of the useless heath, with at present, even at best, only adorns them.

  Peel has had the Gilmore, which is of 500 tons burthen, under his own
  inspection, as well as the selection of the agricultural and other implements
  to convey to the Swan River. There were many passengers on board. Mr Peel and
  his family, it is understood will join the vessel at Plymouth. In the vessel
  there are also going out other settlers. The Hooghly, another ship of 500 tons
  burthen, chartered by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her

  intended for breeding in the settlement, from whence India will be supplied,
  should the settlement answer.– Sunday Times.

  Swan River. –The ship Warrior, Stone, commander, bound to Swan River, Sydney,

  with prospects of favourable weather in her progress down the Channel. The
  Warrior is a fine vessel of about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of
  250 passengers to the new settlement. Several of the passengers are persons of
  independent fortune, who have embarked considerable property in the
  speculation ; and and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the enormous
  sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation the vessel could afford their
  families and suite. Six pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate
  number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians of course accompany
  the instruments to their destination. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs
  of the choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable number of swine,
  two milch cows, and three valuable horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be
  anticipated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, apprehensions are
  entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be consigned to the ocean
  before the termination of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the
  advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander and a gentleman named
  Semple, who has chartered the Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear
  the enormous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.

  of New South Wales wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The New
  South Wales wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices
  averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb., which quotations are higher than
  those last obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van
  Dieman's Land Company, being a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's
  flocks. They met a very ready sale, and the average prices obtained were from
  1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from Germany and other places this year
  are expected to be very great.

  THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The Examiner of Saturday las has some witty remarks on
  the plaint which appeared in our paper on the excess of females over males in
  the census, which he assures us is entirely owing to the lives of females
  being prolonged by their better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the
  habit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom we were supposed by
  implication to be cut off permanently by intemperance! We admit that a few
  hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the number bears any
  proportion to the amount supposed; we have two other remarks to make on his
  statement. First, since our manners were corrupted by imitating English
  fashions, it is whispered, we hope un, that there are such things as tippling
  women in country, some of whom do disappear suddenly–no matter how; and
  secondly, we wish our London friend inform us how it happens, that while all
  Broad England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, Edinburgh should
  have no less than 24! We understand that since this astounding fact was
  brought out, there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to the
  adjoining counties. We know a number who have or are flying to Fife and the
  north. A friend, who careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of the
  Jews. The ladies, he says, attribute their flight to Cholera Maribus!

  The Wool Trade. –The whole of the London public sales of Colonial and other
  woold having now been gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state,
  and transactions by private contract are conducted on a more extensive scale.
  The total amount of the late sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday,
  was 4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the manufactures at the
  extreme advance realized at the previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed,
  quotations from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. The sales on
  Saturday was most fully attended, and increased boldness was observed. The
  colonial wools offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few bales
  were also offered, forming a part of the second clip of wools in the new
  colony on the Swan River. They were much better in quality than those last
  received. Some German lambs' wool also commanded attention, and sold as high
  as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not
  quite so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according to quality, full
  prices were obtained. The sale consisted of 437 bales New South Wales and Van
  Diemen's Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and 72 bales of
  Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. The best fleece of Amsterdam offered
  fetched 2s 10d to 3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the best
  Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s
  4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German
  2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to establish a much firmer
  market for wools of all descriptions than previously existed. The arrivals of
  wool are limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, and abotu 375
  bales of Neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house.

  Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor of the embryo colony in South
  Australia, and we believe that a fitter appointment could not have been made.
  We only regret that Colonel Napier has not been sent to superintend a colony
  founded on something like sane principles. But if this Australian project end,
  as we have little doubt it will do, in the ruin of those who are weak and
  silly enough to embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the failure to
  the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. The whole blame will fall on the
  contrivers of the scheme.

  Emigration. –According to a general return of emigrants who have left
  Liverpool for the British colonies and the United States of America, it
  appears that from the 7th of May 1833, to the 30th September 1834, 3,121
  persons left there for the colonies, and 27,486 for the United States, making
  a grand total of 30,607 persons. The ships employed were 455 ; the tonnage
  196,058, and the crews, 8,9956. The chief of the emigrants to the United
  States, disembarked at New York, 24,311 having landed there. Of the emigrants
  to the colonies, 1,289 went to Australia, and 1,227 to Quebec. The emigration
  to the West Indies during the above period, only amounted to 12 to the smaller
  islands, 3 to Antigua, 32 to Jamaica, and 26 to Demerara. The emigrants to Van
  Diemen's Land were 135.

  part, fine healthy looking girls, some of them of exceedingly interesting

  which prompts to emigration would be supposed to exist.

  Emigration –We observe from an advertisement in our paper of to-day, that
  another ship is fitting out by Government, for the free conveyance of females
  to Van Dieman's Land ; and as we understand that many applications were made
  too late for the last ship, we would recommend those anxious to take advantage
  of this opportunity, to lose no time in making the neccessary application at
  Leith,–the number being strictly limited, and being the last ship to sail this
  year. We consider it of great advantage to females of respectability, that
  none are admitted without a strict investigation into their moral character by
  the Emigration Committee ; and that those of a superior class, as governesses,
  &amp;c. are provided a small sum, to defray the expense of the extra outfit.

  South Australia. –The act of Parliament for founding this colony will now come
  into full operation ; the Commissioners having complied with the conditions
  precedent, by the sale of t35,000 worth of land, and by raisingthe required
  loan for the government of the colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see
  the names of the various officers gazetted (some of them have been long ago
  nominated) ; and we understand that active preparations are making with a view
  to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of emigrants. This
  first expedition will be placed under the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N.,
  the Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors and other qualified
  persons, will carefully examine the various harbours in the colony, the
  quality of the neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will
  select that site which, all things considered, is most desirable for the first
  town. We believe it is the intention of the Commissions not to send out the
  main body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow ample time for
  the necessary preparations for their reception.– Spectator.

  Emigration. –It will be observed, from an advertisement in to-day's paper,
  that Government are fitting another ship for the free conveyance of single
  females from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the great demand for
  agricultural labourers, and mechanics of every description, in that colony, it
  has been resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a cost not above what
  is paid to America–Government paying the remainder of the sum as a bounty,
  amounting to t30, which may certainly be looked upon as a great boon, both by
  individuals and the colony at large. In all the colonies there appears to be a
  scarcity of working people, as from an official document in our possession, it
  is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada agricultural labourers,
  domestic servants, and tradesmen of every description, will be for some years
  in great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from t25 to t30 per annum,
  with board, lodging, and washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day,
  with provisions. The government agent for emigration for the Canadas asserts
  he could find immediate employment for 20,000 working people, as public
  improvements are much retarded for want of hands. As this is the best season,
  we would advise all those intending to emigrate to apply to the government
  agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, who will give gratuitous
  information regarding the colonies, and advise as to the best method of
  putting their plans into execution. The rate of wages for every description of
  mechanics may be likewise seen there.

  Australian Colonies.–We have seen a printed circular containing extracts of a
  letter from Mr John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emigrant ship
  Canton, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, addressed to Edward Forster, Esq.
  chairman of the Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr Sullivan
  mentions that the female emigrants, on landing, were placed in spacious and
  commodious buildings, adjoining the Government House, at Sydney, where every
  attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion. The
  writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a greater proportion of well
  conducted, industrious, and virtuous young women, than were ever before landed
  from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee that came to these Colonies.
  Three-fourths of the young women were engaged, and went into comfortable
  situations, on the first and second days after landing ; and before a week all
  the useful and good servants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work,
  dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many of them in Syndey and the
  surroundings districts ; several were taken up the country to Maitland and
  Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairymaids, or farm servants
  as we had, could obtain places in that time, for these are the descriptions of
  female servants in demand throughout the colony. The wages varied from t8 to
  t20. Some, who were not very good servants of all work and housemaids, got t8
  to t10 ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the latter are much wanted) ;
  housemaids and needlewomen, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to t20. Governesses
  also are much sought for it ; if we had had twenty qualified they could have
  got situations in respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to this
  class are small, say t25 to t40. Nursery governesses got t20. All the male
  emigrants who understood agriculture, or the management of stock in general,
  but particularly sheep, were engaged immediately, at salaries varying from t40
  to t50, with a house and rations for family use." We understand that the
  Canton had a number of females from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and the
  above information must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.

  eight Europeans, part of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, in
  a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver up the men. The Charles
  Eaton was supposed to have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits,
  in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras, but no

  been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with activity, and some railing had

  consigned to prostitution, and that such as obtained services found themselves
  placed among a very different calss of persons to that which they had been

  some of the females "thus launched into the world," were not more than twelve

  Highland Emigrants. –The ship " Midlothian" has just been fitted up at Leith
  for the reception of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the Isle
  of Skye for Sydney, New South Wales. These emigrants are, we believw, to be
  carried out at a very small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the
  passage money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of New South
  Wales, which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and
  promotion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well the relief of those
  districts in this country which are suffering from the want of employment and
  subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well
  disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals, the promotion of
  the moral welfare of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we believe,
  receive employment in New South Wales as farm-servants, shepherds, overseers,
  &amp;c. We had a brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday afternoon,
  and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted up in a manner the most
  comfortable and convenient that could well be effected. She sails this
  afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.

  Thus the British Government is multiplying its colonies round the shores of
  New Holland. Exclusive of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, we
  have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of Port Jackson ; a second
  recently formed at Port Philip, 500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just
  described, at St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ; a fourth
  at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at
  Swan River, 250 miles north from King George's South. All these colonies are
  in the temperate zone, between the latitudes of 30 and 38, and will have
  nearly the same climate. We had one at Melville Island, on the north coast,
  within the torried zone, in latitude 12 ; but it was found to be very
  unhealthy, and was abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.

  the head a person who had been appointed by his friends to see him on board,
  and to look to his affairs before the sailing of the vessel. The wounded man
  was taken to the Infirmary in a very dangerous state, and the assailant to the

  manner which made his friends chary of intrusting him with money in this
  country, and that they had employed the individual referred to, to see him on
  board for Australia, before leaving any under his charge. This indignity is
  supposed to have lain heavy on his mind, and led to the commission of the act

  Afflicting Case of Destitution. –Some time ago a vessel was advertised to sail
  from this port for Australia, and to take out Government settlers free of
  expense. A family in Shetland, consisting of the husband, wife, and six of a
  young family, sold off their effects and came to Leith for the purpose of

  Leith till their little all has been exhausted, and the husband, from the
  combined effects of disappointment and want, has been thrown upon a sick-bed,
  and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. Several private
  individuals, with a benevolence that does them the highest credit, have
  temporarily supplied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is soon
  crippled, and unless something else be immediately done, we may have soon to
  report one or more of their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of
  life. The object of the present notice therefore is to draw forth the
  sympathies of the charitable, to relive a family thus suddenly involved in
  want and misery, who, from their industrious habits and every way excellent
  characters, left their native home with the good wishes of all their friends.

  New Zealand.–On Wednesday a public meeting was held in the Guildhall of the
  city of London, pursuant to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the purpose
  of petitioning her Majesty and both Houses of Parliament " to adopt prompt and
  efficient measures for preserving from invasion or abandonment the
  longestablished sovereignty of the British Crown in the islands of New
  Zealand, at present endangered by foreign pretensions, and by the acts of the
  Executive Government ; also for stopping the course of lawless emigration and
  settlement, which has not only proved deeply injurious to the native people of
  the country, but threatens their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, for
  establishing the most beneficial system of colonization, and the protection
  and restraints of British law, under a distinct colonial government, in place
  of the state of anarchy which now prevails among both races, and all other
  classes of her Majesty's subjects, and others inhabiting or resorting to New
  Zealand, as a distant independency of the territory of New South Wales."
  Including the gentlemen of the hustings, the entire number might be calculated
  at 400 individuals. The Lord Mayor took the chair. Resolutions in accordance
  with the object of the meeting were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P.,
  Mr F. Baring, M.P., Mr Hawes, M.P., Mr G. F. Young, Mr Ward, M.P., and others.
  On the motion of Mr G. Robinson, seconded by Mr Donaldson, a petition was
  adopted by the meeting, to be presented to the Queen by the Earl of Devon, to
  the House of Peers by Lord Ashburton, and to the Commons by Lord Eliot.

  New Zealand–Name of the Capital City. ?It will gratify the admirers of the
  Duke of Wellington to learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand Company
  have resolved that the name of the city founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton
  Harbour, Port Nicholson, and which is destined to become the capital of New
  Zealand, shall be named "The City of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious
  Duke. The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to him the promoters
  of colonization of South Australia were in a great measure indebted for
  securing the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the principles on
  which that colony is founded ; and, as many of the promoters of South
  Australian emigration are Directors of the New Zealand Company, they have
  resolved, setting all party politics aside, to confer this honour on the Duke.
  There could be no stronger proof of the political sagacity and statesmanlike
  views of the Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system of colonization,
  and no better mode of perpetuating his name than by bestowing it on the
  metropolis of the "Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere."

  caused them to send a deputation to London, which, on Tuesday, waited on Lord
  John Russell, to solicit the means of transporting themselves out of the
  ungrateful country which has been enriched by their toils, and, in return,
  refuses them the means of subsistence. Their prayer was to be sent to New

  some general measure on the subject, but in the mean time cannot help them.

  On Monday a discussion of some interest took place in the House of Commons
  relative to the affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain defects in its
  government, that colony has fallen into a state of financial embarassment
  requiring immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the history of the
  settlement from its foundation, and stated that, while its revenue does not
  exceed t20,000 its expenditure has increased to the enormous sum of t130,000 a
  year ! At present its affairs are managed by commissioners, the responsible
  Ministers of the Crown having no direct control over its expenditure. This is
  manifestly an evil, and must form the subject of future legislation, but in
  the meantime it is necessary to provide for the payment of certain bills now
  over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell proposed that her Majesty should be
  authorized to guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. Lord Stanley
  concurred generally in the views of the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but
  though that the Government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought
  in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they proposed that the
  colony should henceforth be governed. Sir Robert Peel suggested that the
  Government should ask a vote of credit for the sum required, which, as it met
  the urgency of the case, was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was
  deferred till Friday.

  Emigration to New Zealand. –On Friday the Tyne left the London Dock, and
  proceeded down the river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. The
  Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 mechanics and labourers, with
  their families, from the Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of
  other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, Chief Justice, and Mr Martin,
  Attorney-General, of the new colony, to which sations they have been recently
  appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the emigrants on board were
  certainly very complete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those persons
  sent out by the company will be provided with a large proportion of their
  provisions fresh, a great quantity of patent preserved provisions being
  shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There are a greater number of
  children than usual in the Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of
  from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, which now lies in the
  London Dock, will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will
  pretty well clear the depot of its present inmates.

  The unsettled state of a great part of the Westtern Frontiers of America (if
  we can suppose that there are any determined frontiers when the settlers are
  making large and continual encroachments) must very much depreciate the sale
  of lands in those parts, notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase
  demanded for vast extents of ground, and the soil being remarkable fertile and
  productive. The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future
  depredations of the Miamis, and some other tribes of Indians, and the
  barbarities before and since committed on the setlers, must occasion other
  people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their
  lives and property on a very precarious teure, unless the arms of the State
  prove remarkably successful in their future attacks.

  The following, it is said, are the authentic particulars of General St Clair's
  expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely
  troublesome to the Americans, and it was determined to drive them to the back
  country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d
  Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St.
  Joseph, where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, but the
  Americans lost the field; several Officers, and 150 men were killed, and they
  were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all
  probability give the Indians new courage, and induce them again to make head
  against the American army.

  The Indians, on the borders of Kentucky, continue to commit the most horrible
  acts of cruelty upon such unfortunate Americans as fall in their power. The
  burning of the Miami villages, and the destruction of their corn and

  more and more vindictive and restless; and being acquainted with all the
  passes in the country, they bid defiance to their pursuers, whom they

  against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians, who have, for some time
  past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray, a Scotchman, who has long
  resided among these Indians. General Wayne, at the head of two thousand
  Provincials, had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the
  battle, Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne
  has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent
  of 200 English miles along the river, which is the boundary of Georgia, after
  which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put it
  out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of
  Virginia.

  The American States having now gained their independence, have no cause of

  Spain. It is well known, that the Indians on the back settlements have been
  regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the
  West-Indies, to enable them to distress the Americans, and prove at least a
  hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi
  has been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas,
  have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.

  Musquito Shore. Intelligence has been received, that in some trivial dispute
  with a native Indian, a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto,
  and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged, being made acquainted
  with the murder, sent a deputation to the Governor, demanding that five
  Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was
  peremptorily refused, as being more than commensurate to the offence, but the
  murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him
  singly, and departed, vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards
  intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men,
  who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed, the Spaniards
  were flying, with the utmost precipitation and terror, from all parts of the
  country, seeking shelter in the forts.

  Extract of a letter from Luxene County."On Saturday the 1st of July, I left
  Tioga point, near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a
  shower appeared to be rising from the north west, and I had scarcely time to
  take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at Sheshequen, before the
  storm came on, attended with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent gale
  of wind with rain. The storm continued upwards of half an hour, during which
  time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm, was surprising. After it
  abated I continued on my journey, but found it very difficult travelling in
  many places, the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached
  Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the
  country, and at the same hour of the day, blew more violent in some places
  than others. At Exeeter, about nine miles from Wilksbarrie, a level plain
  loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for
  more than a mile in length, and three fourths of a mile wide, being either
  torn up by the roots or twisted off, leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet
  high.

  The representations which have been very forcibly urged by the American
  Minister, Mr. Pinckney, include various topics of complaint. Amongst these
  are, the withholding of the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in violation of
  the treaty of 1783; the exciting of the Creek and other Indians to make war
  upon the American frontier; the refusal to make compensation for the property
  seized by the armies under Lord Cornwallis, &amp;c in the Southern States,
  according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the
  impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the sullen
  silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on
  the subject of the claims made by the Republic.

  By the Governor Macquarie are arrived Capt. Fowler, and part of the crew of
  the India brig Matilda, which sailed from this Colony in Aug. 1813, bound on a
  voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from thence to China, but was
  cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at
  anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a
  sandal-wood voyage.– Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted,
  and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark
  night, and the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift;
  by which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and
  filled with water.–When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to
  get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design of putting the
  whole of her crew to death, which appears to have been a constant practise
  among the different islanders towards one another, when their canoes happen by
  accident to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any
  other accident. Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king,
  Nooakretu, who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the
  unfortunate mariners to in stant slaughter:–He withheld his assent to the
  murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The
  crew were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as by
  the gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion,
  that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed by
  many other chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far
  superior in number, sup ported by the common usages of the island, from which
  the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated,
  with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; He had been called to
  the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as it was not a
  hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed their
  solicitations earnestly; and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the
  sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the force of words, which
  not seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in
  an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Find ing that
  all his expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom,
  he deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the
  neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the chief next in
  command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and
  decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and
  then to the other which he had entwined around his own. "These strangers are
  doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that
  I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed per petrated. Let my
  child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will be
  said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these
  unoffending people." The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than
  produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
  mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly
  excel his fellow creature - whose concep tions are moulded by tenets
  calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people
  looked wildly upon their King, whose person they adored, because that his
  principles were good, and his government just and mild. They saw the obedient
  chief, to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted, staring with
  horror and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The
  mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed: and,
  commanded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey– when a sudden
  shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! The King!" from
  every lip burst forth:–'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers
  live: no man shall kill the King!"–Thus were their lives preserved–and the
  vessel plundered of everything on board her.

  American papers are received, dated October, 4. 1794. They contain two letters
  from General Wayne to the American Secretary at War, giving an account of a
  severe action he had with the Indi ans, who were assisted by the volunteers
  and militia of Detroit on the 20th August, on the banks of the Miamis, in the
  vicinity of the British post and garrison at the foot of the Rapids.–The
  action was bloody, and he says, "our army was left in full and quiet
  possession of the field of battle, which terminated under the influence of the
  guns of the British garrison, as you will observe by the inclosed
  correspondence which passed between Major Camp bell Commandant and myself upon
  the occasion." He adds℃"We remained three days and nights on the banks of the
  Miamis, in front of the field of battle; during which time all the houses and
  corn fields were consumed and destroyed for a con siderable distance both
  above and below Fork Mia mis, as well as within pistol shot of that garrison,
  who were compelled to remain tacit spectators to this general devastation and
  conflagration, among which were the stores and houses of Colonel Mac kee, the
  British Indian agent and principal stimu lator of the war now exiting between
  the United States and the Savages.

  CORONER'S INQUEST.–An inquest was held yesterday evening, before Anthony Gell,
  Esq. at the Nag's Head, in Grange-court, Leicester-square, on the body of Ann
  Paris, an unfortunate young creature, of interesting appearance, not more than
  17 years of age, who, it appeared, had been reduced by some unknown melancholy
  circumstance, to the most forlorn and destitute situations. It was stated in
  evidence, that she had taken her lodgings only seven weeks, and that during
  that time she had evinced the most wretched state of mind, and, on Thursday
  morning, urged on by the poignancy of her feelings, or derangement of her
  intellect, she swallowed a considerable quantity of laudanum. On the violence
  of her death-pangs coming on, medical air was sent for, but too late to be of
  any assistance, and in a short time she expired.–The Coroner's Jury returned a
  verdict of Lunacy.

  On Friday, an Inquest was held at the Nag's Head, Leicester-fields, on the
  body of Madamoiselle Ann Paris, then lying dead at No. 4, St. Martin's-street,
  Leicester-fields.– Sarah Upton deposed, that she is housemaid to the place.
  She had frequently observed that the unfortunate young lady appeared to be
  rather flighty and tiresome in her manner, such as ringing the bell violently,
  giving orders, and almost immediately after giving counter-orders; at other
  times she would ring with equal violence, and when any of the servants
  inquired what she wanted, she would tell them she wanted nothing. At one time
  the deceased gave the witness a shilling to buy her some laudanum. The witness
  said, "Good God, Miss, you surely must be mad to think of such a thing;
  besides you know it is contrary to law, and I can't procure it." She then set
  down and wept bitterly; she said she could get it in a minute; she had been
  used to take it for a pain in her bowels.–The witness replied, "Very well,
  miss, you may kill yourself, but I shall not give my assistance to the deed."
  On Wednesday, she went out at two, and returned at half after six o'clock. She
  then said, that she had given a coachman a 1 l. note at Brompton, she had to
  pay the man only 2s. but she would not wait for her change, as she thought it
  was much better to lose money than time. She went out about a quarter of an
  hour, after the time of her coming home, and returned again at eight o'clock,
  having her bonnet all bedizened with artificial flowers. She got a candle,
  went up to her own apartments, and returned in about seven minutes time; she
  refused to take tea with two ladies that were in the parlour at the time; she
  sat down at first in an extremely pensive manner, then, in the course of a
  minute or two, with the utmost wildness in her countenance, she exclaimed,
  "Oh, I shall never see him again! I have done the job–I have taken good care
  that the laudanum I took should do the business." The witness was instantly
  alarmed, knowing that the deceased had ordered her to get some laudanum for
  her before then. She ran up stairs in the utmost consternation, and saw the
  phials in the lady's chamber. Upon her return, she endeavoured to get some
  explanation for the poor young lady as to what induced her to commit such an
  act of desperation, but in vain–she looked wild, and continued raving for some
  time, and then fell into a state of stupefaction. Medical assistance was sent
  for; three Professional Gentlemen attended, but they could afford her no
  relief. She died before day light on Thursday morning. The witness knew
  nothing of any particular visitor to the deceased; neither had she the least
  knowledge of any of her relations or friends. The Jury returned the verdict–
  Insanity.

  The American Congress have laid on port duties, which may be deemed moderate
  in several particulars, when compared to those of most of the European
  kingdoms and cities, and in many instances are much less than heretofore
  imposed by the Provincial Assemblies. This may be hugly prudent in a republic
  which is courting commerce for her ports and for such a variety of articles,
  the native products of that extensive region, to give in return for fabrics
  not yet manufactuted among themselves. Their tobacco, corn iron, hemp, flax
  lumber, &amp; are inexhaustible sources of wealth, and their fisheries very
  considerable.

  "From some late communications it is evident, that as much sugar may be made
  on the new lands in the States of New-York and Pennsylvania as will supply the
  whole United States, and perhaps in a little time furnish an article of
  exportation. The profits of the manufactory of sugar, when made by private
  families, will be greater than when made by large works. A boiler, which will
  cost only 16s. will be the whole expence that will be necessary to carry on
  this business, and the sugar may be made at a season of the year when no work
  can be done upon a farm. The price of it, when sent to Philadelphia, will be
  twice as high as the same quantity of wheat. The sugar trees may be made to
  yield their juice without being injured, and when they decay, fresh ones may
  easily be cultivated in the soil upon which they now grow. When we consider
  the value of sugar, its general and wholesome use in diet, and above all, that
  it has hitherto been obtained at the price of the lives and liberty of our
  African brethren, we cannot help congratulating our fellow citizens upon the
  prospect of manufactories of that article being established among us, whereby
  immense sums of money will be saved to our country, and, what is more, our
  country freed from the guilt of encouraging the detestable traffic in human
  creatures.

  By an extract of a letter from Jamaica we learn the following singular
  fact;–The Captain and crew of the brig Exuma, which arrived there some days
  before from Newfoundland, having in the course of their passage fallen in with
  a French schooner, Captain Alward asked the Captain of the schooner to
  accommodate him with some nails, which he politely did; at the same time
  begging his acceptance of some barracoutes caught that morning. Captain
  Aylward and his crew having dined off them the same day, they were immediately
  seized with violent sickness convulsive fits, and other dangerous symptoms.
  The Captain, judging that the fish they had eaten were of a poisonous nature,
  conceived that salt water might be of service, he instantly made the expedient
  on himself, which relieved him greatly ; he applied the same remedy to his
  crew and it was attended with good effects. When this unfortunate accident
  happened, it was luckily a dead calm ; had the weather been tempestous, it is
  more than probable the ship and crew would have been lost, as during their
  sickness, there was not a man able to stand by the helm.

  By letters received from Norfolk in Virginia, dated the 23rd of July, we learn
  that on the 10th of that month the ship Betsey of Greenock, Capt. James Young,
  had arrived there in 19 days from Jamaica, and brought the following
  melancholy relation which he received from the crew of the Prudence, whom she
  picked up on the 1st of Juin lat. 22. 40. long. 85. 32. That from the 7th to
  the 10th of June the weather had been very hazy, with little wind, so that
  Capt Addies could not get an observation, and a strong current setting to the
  Southward and Westward, drove them farther leeward than they imagined. On the
  12th, about 3 o'clock in the morning, the watch discovered Cape Catuloh, but
  before intelligence could be given to the Captain, she struck. For some time
  she made no water but about seven the water came in so fast, that by eleven
  o'clock, A. M. the water was six feet in the hold (the depth of the water in
  which she lay,) the people being sixteen in number, took to their long boat,
  and endeavoured to make Cape Antonie; but after four days fruitless labour
  they were obliged to return to the wreck, where they found two Spaniards
  plundering, who informed them that there were only four inhabitants on the
  island, and therefore they could receive no assistance from them; upon which,
  having taken a quantity of beef and biscuits aboard, they left the wreck a
  second time, and after having been absent fourteen days, were providentially
  picked up by the ship Betsey, and carried to Norfolk in Virginia.
